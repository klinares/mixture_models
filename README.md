# mixture_models_missing_data
Applying Latent Class Analysis (LCA) to discover patterns of Missing at Random (MAR) in survey data using stan.

<br>

## The idea behind this project came from this [paper](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13645579.2019.1632026) where LCA was utilized to find latent patterns of respondents that use the "don't know" response option. Here we apply it to missing data (non-observation at the item level) across various items on attitudes regarding abortion collected from NORC's [general social survey - 2018](https://gss.norc.org/).
